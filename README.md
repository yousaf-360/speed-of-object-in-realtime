# Real-time Object Speed Measurement

## Project Overview
This Python Notebook demonstrates the real-time measurement of an object's speed using OpenCV. Additionally, a user-friendly menu has been developed using Tkinter for a seamless user experience.

## Features
- Real-time speed measurement of moving objects.
- User interface menu with Tkinter for easy interaction.

## Environment Setup
Ensure you have the required libraries installed:

pip install opencv-python tkinter

## Usage
- Open the notebook in your Jupyter environment.
- Run the cells sequentially to load the necessary libraries and functions.
- Adjust the camera parameters such as distance (3.25 feet) and field of view (5.83) in the provided variables.
- Run the cell for real-time speed measurement and observe the output.

## Parameters
- Distance from the camera to the object: 3.25 feet.
- Total field of view of the camera: 5.83.
- Feel free to experiment with different parameters and customize the code according to your requirements.

## Dependencies
- OpenCV
- Tkinter
