# Real-time Object Speed Measurement

## Project Overview
This IPython Notebook demonstrates the real-time measurement of an object's speed using OpenCV. Additionally, a user-friendly menu has been developed using Tkinter for a seamless user experience.

## Features
- Real-time speed measurement of moving objects.
- User interface menu with Tkinter for easy interaction.

## Environment Setup
Ensure you have the required libraries installed:

pip install opencv-python tkinter

##Usage
Open the notebook in your Jupyter environment.
Run the cells sequentially to load the necessary libraries and functions.
Adjust the camera parameters such as distance (3.25 feet) and field of view (5.83) in the provided variables.
Run the cell for real-time speed measurement and observe the output.

##Parameters
Distance from the camera to the object: 3.25 feet.
Total field of view of the camera: 5.83.
Feel free to experiment with different parameters and customize the code according to your requirements.

##Dependencies
OpenCV
Tkinter
